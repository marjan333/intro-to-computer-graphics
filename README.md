# introduction-to-computer-graphics
Our project for Introduction to Computer Graphics.

We have lanterns in three-dimensional space. 
A user can travel in this space and lanterns can interact by clicking to switch it on or off.
Lanterns can disappear from the screen when a user goes further into three-dimensional space.
The background is FIREFLIES. As an alternative, we can have space with stars (maybe shooting ones, idk.)
Chime-like sounds when you move through the lanterns.
